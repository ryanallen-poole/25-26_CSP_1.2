#   a123_apple_letters.py
#TODO Create a function that takes a turtle as its parameter and gives that turtle (apple)
# a new location on the tree, only if the list of letters is not empty. Associate the
# turtle with a new letter selected at random from the list of letters

#TODO Create a function that takes a turtle (apple) and its corresponding letter from the letter
# list and draws that letter on that turtle (apple)

#TODO Create a function that takes a turtle (apple) and its corresponding ltter from the letter
# list and set that turtle to be shaped by the image file, call the letter drawing function,
# and update the Screen

#TODO Iterate over the numbers from 0 to the number of apples, creating that many turtles
# calling your function that resets the apples by giving them a new random location
# add the new apples to a list of apples to be used in the rest of the program.
# The loop below executes the correct number of times by using the range() function
# to create a list of numbers to iterate over.



#TODO Create a function that takes a letter as its parameter, uses that letter to retrieve the
# corresponding turtle (apple) and causes both to drop from the tree simultaneously. Once the
# apple and letter have dropped, call the apple reseting function.

#TODO define a function per letter that you will use in your program. Each function should check
# to see if the given letter is in the list of letters; if it is, it should drop the corresponding
# apple.



#TODO use the onkeypress method of wn to correlate the functions you defined above with each
# of the letters that the user might type.
# onkeypress requires that you name one function that must take
# no arguments to be called when the specified key is pressed.
